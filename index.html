    <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>I am a driven leader, marketer, and relationship improvement expert. These claims have been proven in my former role as an Area Director for Young Life, and they have also been demonstrated many times in my professional career when building important relationships with executives, business owners, supervisors, coworkers, customers, and influencers.</p>

      <p>I have reached a point in my prior career path that I feel it would be best for me to change careers. I see becoming a Full-Stack Java Developer as a valuable skill and a career direction that fits the way I think, I function, and I work. I have invested significant time to see if programming is a strong fit for my personality strengths and career goals, and I feel as though becoming a Full-Stack Developer will be a great fit for a new career and direction</p>

      <p>I continually look for innovative, beneficial, and increasingly productive ways to accomplish tasks and exceed goals. I am driven to accomplish relevant goals by taking the initiative to discover the strategies and pathways needed. I work exceptionally well on teams as well as autonomously, thrive in collaborative environments, and have a demonstrated ability to inspire others.</p>

      <p>My passion is for assessing and analyzing issues, offering appropriate solutions, and completing responsibilities and goals. I am also passionate about learning, improving, and seeking mentorship and coaching from successful people.</p>
